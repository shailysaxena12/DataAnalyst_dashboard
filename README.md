This project is an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel to analyze and visualize road accident casualty data. The dashboard provides clear insights into accident severity, vehicle types, road conditions, time trends, and environmental factors to support data-driven decision-making.

Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Excel)
📌 Project Overview

The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard is an interactive data visualization project developed entirely in Microsoft Excel using dummy data.
The main objective of this project is to analyze road accident casualties and identify key patterns related to accident severity, vehicle type, road conditions, weather, location, and time trends.
